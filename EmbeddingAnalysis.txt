When looking at the embedding analysis, I noticed that the same words reappeared in the lowest 10 for each dimension.
This may be attributed to the fact that both authors may have used these words in the same context and style. I thought
this was interested if this was true, because we can do more empirical analyses on the parallels between writing styles.

An example of this was found in my 10th dimension:
Dimension 10 :
Top 10: ['bennet'] ['elizabeth'] ['acquaintance'] ['darcy'] ['aunt'] ['meryton'] ['character'] ['affection'] ['collins'] ['charlotte']
Lowest 10: ['diary']['van']['september']['count']['sleep']['lucy']['dr']['held']['big']['feet']

and my 6th dimension:
Dimension 6 :
Top 10: ['elizabeth'] ['bennet'] ['jane'] ['darcy'] ['character'] ['acquaintance'] ['longbourn'] ['lizzy'] ['collins'] ['affection']
Lowest 10: ['dr']['september']['van']['jonathan']['feet']['helsing']['night']['mina']['blood']['death']

The words dr, van, feet, and september all reappeared in both dimensions.

As to what each dimensions mean, I was a bit confused about how to answer that question. But my best guess would be that
each dimension is looking for correlations between the relative distances of where each word was used relative to
each other.
